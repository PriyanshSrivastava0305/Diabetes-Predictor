## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood of diabetes based on input health metrics. The model utilizes supervised learning techniques and is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators, such as blood pressure, glucose levels, and BMI.

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Data Cleaning
- **Missing Values**: Handled by either removing rows with missing values or imputing with mean/median.
- **Outliers**: Extreme values were identified and treated to prevent skewing the model.
- **Normalization**: Data was normalized to ensure all features are on the same scale, which improves model convergence.

### 2. Feature Engineering
- **Feature Selection**: Key features with high correlation to diabetes were selected.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Categorical variables were transformed into a numerical format if necessary.
- **Feature Scaling**: Used standard scaling on continuous variables to improve model performance.

## Model Selection

After testing several machine learning algorithms, we chose a model that best fits the data for accuracy, interpretability, and performance:

- **Algorithms Considered**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
- **Final Model**: Based on initial performance, Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its robustness and high accuracy in classification tasks. It handles feature importance automatically, which was useful in identifying the most impactful variables.

## Training and Hyperparameters

### 1. Data Splitting
- The dataset was divided into a training set (80%) and a test set (20%).

### 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
- **Random Search** and **Grid Search** were employed to optimize hyperparameters, such as:
  - Number of estimators: 100, 200, 500
  - Maximum depth: 5, 10, 15
  - Minimum samples split: 2, 5, 10
  
- **Final Parameters**: 
  - Number of estimators: 200
  - Maximum depth: 10
  - Minimum samples split: 5

## Evaluation Metrics

The following metrics were used to evaluate the model's performance:

1. **Accuracy**: Measures the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
2. **Precision**: Indicates how many of the positively classified cases were actually positive.
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Shows the model’s ability to detect positive cases correctly.
4. **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.
5. **AUC-ROC**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes, with 1 being perfect discrimination.

### Results

| Metric       | Score       |
|--------------|-------------|
| Accuracy     | 0.85        |
| Precision    | 0.83        |
| Recall       | 0.80        |
| F1-Score     | 0.82        |
| AUC-ROC      | 0.88        |

The model achieved an accuracy of 85%, indicating strong predictive performance with a high AUC-ROC, showing it effectively distinguishes between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations
- **Imbalanced Data**: The model's performance may be affected if the dataset contains an imbalance between positive and negative cases.
- **Limited Features**: The dataset may not cover all relevant health metrics, potentially limiting predictive power.
- **Overfitting**: Although minimized, overfitting remains a risk with complex models like Random Forest.

### Future Work
- **Data Augmentation**: Adding more data points to reduce the risk of overfitting.
- **Feature Expansion**: Incorporating additional health metrics such as cholesterol and lifestyle factors.
- **Model Optimization**: Experimenting with ensemble methods and neural networks for improved accuracy.
